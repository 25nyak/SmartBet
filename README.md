## Description

SmartBet is a betting platform that besically allow users to place bets using crypto. Users can select thier bets and place them by buying our tokens (ERC721) and staking them. For users to buy our tokens with their crypto currencies (native/standard), tthey will have to convert to BUSDs to obtain tokens(ERC721) and use them to place bets and stake.
If the odds on a bet is 10x. staking 1 unit of our token will get the user 10 units if he wins the bet but if user lose the bet, his stake will be withdraw into the platform's wallet.

### Betting Odds and Probability

Betting odds represent the probability of an event to happen and therefore enable you to work out how much money you will win if your bet wins. As an example, with the odds of 4/1, for every £1 you bet, you will win £4. There is a 20% chance of this happening, calculated by 1 / (4 + 1) = 0.20.

Calculating the probability of staker winning and/or platform losing money:
% = den / (den + num)

For example, if the odds are 4 to 1, the probability equals 1 / (1 + 4) = 1/5 or 20%.
A favourite horse might be quoted at odds of 2 to 1, which mathematically would represent a probability of 33.3%

Farmers' share = 75% of InvestmentReturn

Incentive (Bettor RoI) = (initialValue / totalReserveOfPreviousCycle) * farmersShare
